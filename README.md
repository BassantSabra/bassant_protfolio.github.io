# Data Analyst

I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in research. I am driven by a passion for exploring details to uncover meaningful insights. My engineering and scientific research background honed my analytical skills and precision, which now power my work in data analysis. I specialize  ⁠in performing data cleaning and preprocessing to enhance coverage and quality, such as data profiling, data cleansing, and data validation, using data quality tools and frameworks. Moreover, I leverage tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to transform the data into actionable strategies. Transitioning from research to analytics allows me to apply my meticulous approach to solving real-world problems and driving impactful decisions.
